## Testing

Did a manual test to see if the database results displayed on the recipes page.

Did some manual test on the recipes search box to see if the recipes with the typed name show on the cards. 

Did some manual test on the ingredients search box to see if the recipes with the typed ingredient show on the cards. 
Had to make sure the ingredient names entered were capitalized as they are in the data base.

Used Text index's to to support text search queries on string content.

Queryed the ingresdients array to seach for the data with the specific user input value.

Filter search
* To take the filter to the next level would be to filter and only find results that match both or all queries selected but i 
found this difficult unless i used text indexing which i had used on the recipe search but found it hard to implement on other searches at the same time.
* filter search lookes for any recipes that have the chosen fields and displays them.
* test was done manually to make sure that what ever was filtered through displayed.
